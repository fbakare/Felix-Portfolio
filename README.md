# About Felix 
As a versatile professional with strong expertise in Mathematics, Statistics, Computer Science, and Business Analytics, I specialize in transforming complex data into actionable insights that drive business decision-making and manage financial risks. My background includes advanced predictive modeling, quantitative analysis, and data visualization using tools such as Python, R, SQL, and Power BI.

I've had the opportunity to lead a pioneering Mathematics and Statistics Research Laboratory at one of Nigeria's leading universities, where I developed innovative models and applied advanced analytics to solve complex research and business problems. My academic journey, which spans multiple degrees, has honed my ability to connect data science with business operations to deliver real-world solutions.

I'm passionate about using data-driven insights to drive strategic growth, improve operational efficiency, and minimize risks. Currently, I'm looking for data science, business analytics, quantitative risk analysis, and data-driven managerial roles that challenge my skills and allow me to contribute to forward-thinking teams. I thrive in environments that foster innovation, collaboration, and continuous learning.
